# High-Performance Temporal Interference Stimulation Envelope Solver Module based on JAX

This project provides a high-performance computing module based on the `JAX` framework for rapidly solving the envelope field distribution of Temporal Interference Stimulation (TIS).

Temporal interference technology generates a low-frequency envelope at the difference frequency by superimposing high-frequency currents, which is used to achieve non-invasive focused stimulation of deep brain regions. The calculation of the envelope field is a major computational bottleneck in TIS simulation and optimization, especially in fine models requiring the processing of a large number of voxels.

This module utilizes `JAX`'s optimization strategies such as `Just-In-Time (JIT)` compilation and vectorization to significantly improve the speed of envelope field calculation, and can be used to accelerate research work such as TIS-based neuromodulation simulation and parameter optimization.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **High Efficiency:** Based on JAX, significantly improves envelope field calculation speed through JIT compilation and hardware acceleration (CPU/GPU).
  * **Formula Implementation:** Implements the formula used in temporal interference stimulation to calculate the maximum value of the envelope field in any direction, suitable for processing electric field vectors.

$$
\begin{equation}
\left| \vec{E}_{AM}(\vec{r}) \right| =
\begin{cases}
2 \left| \vec{E}_2(\vec{r}) \right|, \text{if } \left| \vec{E}_1(\vec{r}) \right| < \left| \vec{E}_2(\vec{r}) \right| \cos(\alpha) \\
\quad                                                                                                \\
\dfrac{2\left| \vec{E}_2(\vec{r}) \times ( \vec{E}_1(\vec{r}) - \vec{E}_2(\vec{r})) \right|}{\left| \vec{E}_1(\vec{r}) - \vec{E}_2(\vec{r}) \right|}, \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

Where $\\alpha$ represents the angle between $\\vec{E}\_1(\\vec{r})$ and $\\vec{E}\_2(\\vec{r})$. This formula is valid only when $\\alpha \< \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $|\\vec{E}\_1(\\vec{r})| \> |\\vec{E}\_2(\\vec{r})|$. Otherwise, $\\vec{E}\_2(\\vec{r})$ needs to be reversed and swapped with $\\vec{E}\_1(\\vec{r})$.

* **Easy Integration:** Can be used as a standalone computation function, convenient for integration into other TIS simulation or optimization frameworks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* JAX and JAXlib (Requires selecting the appropriate backend for installation based on your hardware, supports CPU and GPU acceleration)
* NumPy

## üì• Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ayakacxy/TIS_envelope.git](https://github.com/ayakacxy/TIS_envelope.git)
cd TIS_envelope
```

2.  **Install dependencies**

```bash
### Create virtual environment
conda create -n envelop_solve python=3.9

# Install JAX (CPU version)
pip install -U jax

# If you have a CUDA GPU, it is recommended to install the GPU version for optimal performance
# Please refer to the official JAX documentation to select the corresponding jaxlib version for your CUDA version
# [https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html)
# Example (for CUDA 12):
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"
```

*Please be sure to refer to the official JAX installation guide to ensure the installed JAXlib version is compatible with your CUDA version.*
Also, it is currently tested that `torch==2.6.0` and `jax=0.6.0` are compatible under `cuda=12.2`. Although `jax`'s `cudnn` version is higher, running it concurrently with `torch` does not cause issues. **The GPU version of JAX currently cannot run on Windows, please refer to the official JAX documentation [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/) for details.**

## üöÄ Usage

The core functionality of this module is a function that takes two electric field tensors as input and returns the corresponding envelope field magnitude tensor.

Assume your finite element model has $N$ voxels, and the electric field at each voxel is a 3D vector $(E\_x, E\_y, E\_z)$. For two current frequencies, you will obtain two electric field tensors $E\_1$ and $E\_2$.

Input Format Requirements:

* `E_1`: The electric field tensor generated by the first frequency, shape `(N, 3)` as a NumPy or JAX array.
* `E_2`: The electric field tensor generated by the second frequency, shape `(N, 3)` as a NumPy or JAX array.

Function Call Example:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import numpy as np
from env_jax import envelop_jax


N = 10
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
E1_np = np.random.rand(N, 3) * 0.1  # Example NumPy array
E2_np = np.random.rand(N, 3) * 0.1

# Convert NumPy arrays to JAX arrays to enable JAX acceleration
E1_jax = jnp.array(E1_np)
E2_jax = jnp.array(E2_np)

# Solve for the interference envelope
envelope = envelop_jax(E1_jax, E2_jax)

print("E1 shape:", E1_jax.shape)
print("E2 shape:", E2_jax.shape)
print("Envelope shape:", envelope.shape) # Output shape should be (N,)
```
